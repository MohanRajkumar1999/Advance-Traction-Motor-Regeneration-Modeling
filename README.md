# Advance-Traction-Motor-Regeneration-Modeling
In this simulink model you can understad
 1. Motor operating characteristics and motor operating modes (Braking and Motoring)
 2. The steady-state study of the electric motor operating region, understanding the field 
weakening of motors
 3. Estimating electric motor performance from datasheets
 4. Performing numerical hand calculations to calculate stall torque, nominal torque & peak 
torque, and nominal speed & peak speed of a motor
 5. This module mainly focuses on advanced motor modeling on motor current w.r.t torque and 
motor voltage w.r.t RPM then understanding the selection of motors based on the 
simulation data
 6. Understanding the working of regenerative braking in electric vehicles, motors working in 
regenerative mode, and studying the regenerative limitations of a cell and a battery pack
 7. Modeling friction & regen braking fraction, creating a motor model which includes the 
regenerative limitations of the motor and estimating the regenerative power of the motor in 
regenerative mode using regen control logic at the motor system
